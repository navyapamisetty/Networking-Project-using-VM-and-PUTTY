# Networking-Project-using-VM-and-PUTTY
This repository contains a setup of a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) with a sample PHP web application that collects user data and supports file uploads. 
The server is configured on a CentOS virtual machine using VirtualBox with NAT and bridged networking. 
A cloned DB server handles MySQL separately, demonstrating multi-VM architecture using VirtualBox.
